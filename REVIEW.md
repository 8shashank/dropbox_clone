# Review of Phil Hawkins by Chris Lee

## Overview

The added code adds onto to the UI. Whenever a change is made in the folders, the user is notified of a change and a time stamp is printed. The format of print exclaims that a change has been made and releases the time a change had been made.

A sync update currently only occurs when changes are made. There is code that can be used to call an update, but isnt working properly.

## Suggested Improvements

1. The console.log statement with the time stamp should be moved until after the change has been made.
2. Clarify when promptedUpdate is true and the implementation. (Or take it out)
3. Define the functionality of the userOps: update (What is this operation supposed to do)
4. Cleaned up code unneeded code and made it continuous, meshed into the other operation statements
5. Simplified the time stamp.
