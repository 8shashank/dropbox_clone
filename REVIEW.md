# Review of Matthew Owens by Edward Yun

## Overview

This code adds an Ignore_List.text file that allows the user to specific certain files that should be ignored when syncing between the two folders. 

The code also adds a matcher for checking if files have matching names, sizes, and contents, and a command line interface that asks for directories to use instead of taking them as directories.
