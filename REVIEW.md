# Review of Eric Yang by Baihua Xuan 

## Overview

*Provide a 1-3 paragraph overview of the architecture of the code and the design rationale.*

## Suggested Reading Materials

*Optionally, provide links to any reading materials that you believe would be beneficial to the reviewee.*

## Suggested Improvements

*Provide a list of 5+ aspects of the code that should be improved. Each suggestion for improvement should be accompanied by a GitHub pull request on the reviewee's submission repo that shows how to perform the suggested refactoring. If the change is so substantial that it is "rewriting" the solution, break it down into a series of refactorings that build on each other to improve the solution (each refactoring committed separately and submitted as a pull request with a thorough explanation).*
