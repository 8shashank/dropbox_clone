# Review of Taylor Zhang by Doug Lisk

## Overview

This code creates a log file using stdin/stdout. The code first prompts the user for a username and then write to the log the name of the file edited, the user who edited this file, and the time at which it was edited.

## Suggested Improvements
Prompting the user for a comment or message to go along with the log entry would allow anyone reading the log to better follow changes to the files over time.
