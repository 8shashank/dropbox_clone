# Review of Taylor Zhang by Doug Lisk

## Overview

This code creates a log file using stdin/stdout. The code first prompts the user for a username and then write to the log the name of the file edited, the user who edited this file, and the time at which it was edited.

## Suggested Improvements
1. Prompting the user for a comment or message to go along with the log entry would allow anyone reading the log to better follow changes to the files over time. 
2. Writing a different log for each file would allow the user to keep track of files added as well as changes made to files that were already in place more easily.
3. Adding a command pattern to this functionality would allow the log to be undone or edited in case I misenter my username or want to undo a file change
