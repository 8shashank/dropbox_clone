Added ability to have different logins
When creating a new login, the username and password is inserted into a MySQL database. The password is hashed with
  the MD5 algorithm.
When logging in, the MySQL database is queried. If the correct username and password is entered, the user's folder in
  the server folder will sync with the client folder.
Added user operation to list files that are in the current folder
