For this assignment, I added a feature that allows the user to send a link to something in their dropbox.
This is achieved by creating an http server and utilizing streams.
How to use it
1. open a separate terminal window and cd into the assignment2 directory
2. enter node lib/sync/sync-server.js into the command line to start the server (the dropbox server must not be running)
3. enter node index.js instead of dropbox before the client-side command of the original assignment instructions
4. once you have received notification that the server is running you can then share links
5. to view the link yourself you can use localhost:8000/***file path***
   to send a link to another person you will have to obtain your ip address first, then construct the link
   http://ip address:8000/***file path***
   for example:
   localhost:8000/lib/sync/sync-server.js should allow you to see the sync-server.js file in your browser
   http://10.67.16.47:8000/lib/sync/sync-server.js would allow someone else to see the syn-server.js file

Caveats
1. This feature will only work on the Vanderbilt network because of security settings.
