This code implements an http-server to provide a web interface and a web server to seemingly connect
across multiple devices. I haven't personally experienced or tested this new functionality but it
appears effectively implemented in a streamlined manner, and also thoroughly tested. This is done
primarily through http-server.js and http-server-test.js, and through what appears to be a section of
other imported libraries.

Suggested improvements:
1) pointed out convenience of increased logging in http-server-test.js
2) discussion of overall functionality of index.js
3) discussion of possible addition to assert function that's featured in http-server-test.js
4) discussion of index.html and what it provides to the application
5) suggested inclusion of increased error logging in http-server.js
